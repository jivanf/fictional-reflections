When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I can use a remote when I am working with someone and we need to share our work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Becuase maybe I'll want some files to stay only in GitHub and not to have the locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are like a group of commits, when you clone a repository it means that you are making a copy of it, without changing anything. When you fork a repository it means that you copy the repository of someone else, while keeping the credits of the one who made it. When you fork a repository, you can't edit that repository.
