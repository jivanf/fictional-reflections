-How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me so that i could see the diffs between the file that 
was working and the one that wasn't working. After that, I could spot
the typos or error in the new file and then fix them.

-How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It makes you a more efficient programmer because instead of saving the older file in one of your folders
you can check the history for that file, and by doing this you take less time.

-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros & Cons of creating the commit manually manually.

PROS: 
* You have control to when saving a file or when not.
* The commits won't be too big or too small, they will be just how you want them.

CONS:
* You take more time creating the commit manually.
* You may forget to create the commit.

-Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git allows you to save the type of file you want, for example an HTML file or a CSS file, which may be needed to be changed at the same time.
Meanwhile, Google Docs only lets you save text files.

-How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use them within a repository. When i do git log, I can see how many times the repository has been changed, but I can use git diff 
so that i can see the differences between one change and another.

-How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
By using version control, you can access older versions of the file you are working on and if you encounter a bug,
you can find it by going through older versions of that file, using version control.

-Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
